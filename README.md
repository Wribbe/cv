# CV

This is my CV, enjoy.

## Quick Start

  * Have python3 installed.
  * Run `python3 run.py`.
  * Point a web browser to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
  * Got to [http://localhost:5000/pdf](http://localhost:5000/pdf) to render a
      cv.pdf to the local root dir.


## Known Issues

  Chrome does not want to play nice with the size of full-time / part-time
  unicode symbols, they differ a bit in size when viewed in Chrome. (Firefox
  recommended!)
